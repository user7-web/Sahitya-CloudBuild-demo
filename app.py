#This app.py is a simple Flask application that serves as a demonstration
# for CI/CD to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
# It has two routes: the root route ("/") which returns a message indicating that CI/CD to GKE is working, and a health check route ("/health") which returns an "OK" status with a 200 HTTP status code. The application listens on all available interfaces on port 8080.
